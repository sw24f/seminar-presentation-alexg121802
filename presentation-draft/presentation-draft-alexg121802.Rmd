## Abstract
  - Dankel, SJ and Loenneke, JP. Effect sizes for paired data should use the change score variability rather than the pre-test variability. J Strength Cond Res 35(6): 1773–1778, 2021—

### What is effect size 
  - Blah Blah Blah (source in parentheses)
  - how is it different from T test statistic
  - where r they used? (meta analyses specifically for sports and exercise science)

## Main Issue 
In effect size calculations, people tend to use the wrong kind of variability in their calculations. What are the two different types? 

### Variability of the Study Sample

## Introduction

- Meta-analyses usually use 3 effect size measures: 
  - Cohen's d 
  - Hedge's g 
  - Glass delta
